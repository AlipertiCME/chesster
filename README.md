# chesster
Chess playing companion for teaching Matlab, Arduino, and Solidworks

## Project Overview 
Chesster was designed to be used as a training aid for ME202- Computational Methods, a course taught by the United States Military Academy Department of Civl and Mechanical Engineering. 
After completing ME202 and ME201 - Intro to Mechanical Engineering Desgin, mechanical engineering Cadets have the requisite skills in Solidworks, Matlab and Arduino to complete this project.

Chesster conssits of three primary programs 
1. A rudimentary computer vision program using an OV7670 connected to an Arduino Uno and Matlab. The Matlab functions takes images of the chess board and using matrix operations determines what moves have been made.
2. A basic chess engine using Matlab. The engine is basd on a two layer pruned decision tree algorithm which is very useful for teaching matrix operations in Matlab but does not make for a very skilled opponent.
3. A gantry based robot that is built 

### required Hardware
